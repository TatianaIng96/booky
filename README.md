# Booky: Individual Project - Make it Real TOP Program v30

This project was developed using Next.js for the frontend and Sass as a preprocessor for CSS. We used Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB database.

Booky is a page designed to buy books online. It offers a wide selection of titles from different genres and authors. Whether you're looking for novels, non-fiction books, classic literature, or children's books, Booky has something for every book lover.

## Characteristics of the project:

- It is a book page that allows you to buy books.
- Allows the user to create an account, add books to the cart and purchase one or more books

## Getting Started

For the project to function correctly, 3 repositories must be cloned that correspond to the back-end, the front-end and the project that contains the landing page:

1. Clone the repositories to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/TatianaIng96/booky.git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/TatianaIng96/my-proyect.git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/TatianaIng96/back-booky.git
```

2. Change directory to /booky:

```
cd booky
```

Also change to /back-booky in the second repository:

```
cd back-booky
```

Also change to /my-proyect in the last repository:

```
cd my-proyect
```

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:

Make sure to have installed Node.js:

```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then, run npm install on each of the repositories:

```
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file to include the backend URL.

5. Run the code!

Make sure to be in each repository:

```
cd booky
```

Once there, execute

```
npm run dev
```

in my-proyect run:

```
npm run develop
```

For the backend, execute the same commands. Remember to keep both running!

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
